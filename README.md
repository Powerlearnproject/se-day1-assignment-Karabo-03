#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a fundamental discipline that plays a critical role in our increasingly digital world, a  process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems, is continuously evolving, keeping pace with emerging technologies and changing industry trends. and best practices. Software engineering manages the complexity of their software development projects. It empowers them to identify improvement areas and find new ways to reduce costs. Through its principles and approaches, software engineers have been able to bridge the gap between technology and business and create reliable, secure, and efficient software solutions. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Planning: Defines the project scope, goals and deliverbles. Identifies and documents requirements. 
  - analysis: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface, it includes architecture, components and interfaces. 
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Deploy the software to production or user 
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. A traditional linear approach to software development that follows a sequential phase by phase process which is completed one after the other with no overlap. It is predictable as everything is upfront , changes to requirements or design are difficult and costly to implement the documentation is created at each phase. It is inflexible and high risk to use as it does not respond well to making changes when the projects has been implemented. Waterfall can be easy to manage as long as there no changes done once the developers have started with the project. Requirements are gathered and documented upfront to reduce misunderstanding. The timeline is predictable and budget is defined upfront, making it easier to plan. 
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. The core values of agile method are to deliver working software in short iterations rather than comprehensive documentation. Prioritize people and communication over processes and tools. Collaborate with customers and stakeholders throughout the development process. Agile embrace change and adapt to new requirements and priorities. Agile is suitable for projects with unclear or changing requirements. Its iterative approach helps mitigate risks by delivering working software in short iterations. Its flexibility and adaptability make it suitable for innovative or experimental projects. Agile promote collaboration and teamwork, making it suitable for teams that value open communication and transparency.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. Known as a programmer or coder, their key responsibility is designing and development software applications, systems or features using programming languages. they test and debug software applications to identify and fixs errors, defects or bugs. Maintains and upadetes existing software systems to ensure they continue to meet the changing needs of users. Problem solving analyzing and develop craetive solutions to complex software development challenges. 
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans. Plays a vital role in ensuring the delivery of high quality software. They test to identify defects and ensure the software meets he required standards. QA develops and implemets quality plans, processes and standards to ensure the software meets the requirements. QA identifies areas for process improvementand implement changes to optimize the software development lifecycle. Identifies and mitigates risks that could impact the quality of the software product. QA collaborates with cross functional teams. Their responsibilities are to plan testing, execute tests, defect management, test automation, process compliance, collect and analyze metrics to measure the effectiveness of testing process, identify,report and track defects  
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. Plays a crucail role in leading and directing software engineering teams to deliver projects on time, within the bidget and to the required quality standards. Their responsibilities are develop and manage project plans, including setting goals, objectives, timelines and budgets. lead and direct cross-functional teams, including software developers, quality assurance engineers and designers. Communicate project status, progress and issues to stakeholders. Manage changes to the project scope, ensuring that changes are properly assessed, approved and implemented. Develop and manage projects and completed on time and to the required quality standards. establish and manage project budgets should align with the project plan. 
 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software application that provides a comprehensive development environment. it helps improve in productivity that can automate many tasks such as code completion, debugging and testing. It enhances code quality, reduces errors, faster development allows the developers to create working protypes and applications more quicker, it improves collaboration by facilitating collaboration among team members helping them to share code in real-time. IDE is an essential tool for software developers. (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). 
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Helps developers track changes to their code. Using vcs tools improve collaboration enable teams to work on the same code, it provides a complete record of all changes made to the codebase, VCS provides a backup of the codebase making it easier to recover in case of data loss or corruption(e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.To ensure that the product outcomes align with expectations and requirements, a solid process and line of communication need to be established. the best practices to follow are to, Define and agree on the scope of the project, Don’t assume end-user needs and requirements, Communicate the needs and expectations between the development and ideation teams, Involve users from the start of existing product refurbishment, Create a clear, concise, and thorough requirements document and confirm your understanding of the requirements and Create a prototype to confirm and/or refine the final agreed-upon requirements.
 Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. Breaking down the requirements into smaller logical chunks. It is more efficient to size smaller tasks and aggregate them than to give a ballpark estimation for the entire project. Clarify all assumptions of the project. Always confirm your assumptions with the client. It is a best practice to document the assumptions for future use.
 Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. it is also known as design debt, it occurs if a developer wants cut cost or take short cuts to complete a task. Simple way to overcome technical debt is not to do it short cuts and use agile method to rectify the mistakes. 
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. A unit can be a method, a function, a class, or even a module. It refers to the smallest testable part of a software application that performs a specific function or behavior
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystem, software application are tested together as a group to ensure that they work as intended and are integrated correctly. The aim of integration tests is to identify issues that might come up when multiple components work together, ensures that individual code units can work as a whole cohesively.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole and ensures that the software meets its functional and non-functional requirements. It is typically performed after integration testing, evaluate the software application’s behavior in various scenarios and under different conditions, including normal and abnormal usage, to ensure that it can handle different situations effectively. 
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. It is known as a quality assurance, confirms the software's stability and checks for flaws. Acceptance testing includes the following phases: plan, test, record, compare and result. it helps developers understand business needs for each function in the tested software


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The process of designing, crafting and optimizing text prompts or inputs to elict specific desired responses from language models. Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.  the imporatnce of interating with AI models improves the accuracy and relevance of responses in chatbots and virtual assistants, Enhance the accuracy and fluency of language translation systems, improves the quality and relevance of text summeries generated language models. Use design prompts to improve quality and relevant and engaging content. it minimizes ambiguity and certainty in the language model's responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Write a story about something interesting."
Write a story about your learning journey about AI technologies and the benefits of AI?
the improved prompt is more clear, it provides more specific details about the story and also provides direction which guide the tone, style and the length of story.
